# Restaurant Inventory Management Software

This software was written in 2018 for Tampopo Restaurant in New York. It's main purpose is to help restaurants create supply orders to multiple vendors in one click. It's functionality includes:

- Search, filter, and view restaurant inventory items
- Add or remove items from inventory
- Add out-of-stock items to cart
- Click "order", group items in cart by vendor, and generate text messages to restaurant vendors with order information

Future improvements include:

- Add Twilio to send text messages automatically
